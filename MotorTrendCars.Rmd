#plotting the reltionship between horsepower and mpg with added features to discrimate between different cylinder types

mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = cyl, color = cyl)) + 
  labs(title = "Relationship between Horsepower and MPG",        subtitle = "by # of cylinders", 
       x = "Horsepower", 
       y = "Miles Per Gallon", 
       color = "Cylinders") + 
  scale_color_viridis_b() + 
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(3,5))

#As expected, 4-cylinder vehicles have to highest mpg and 8-cylinder have the lowest. Interestingly, this visual shows that increases in horsepower have the strongest effect of reducing mpg on the 4-cylinder cars. There is much less of an effect on 8-cylinder cars.
